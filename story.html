      <p class="post-body">SilverVale Nutrition, a Texas-based infant formula manufacturer, is facing mounting public backlash after deploying a controversial corporate restructuring strategy known as the "Texas Two-Step" following a costly courtroom defeat.</p>
      <p class="post-body">Last autumn, a federal jury in Illinois found that SilverVale's specialized premature-infant formula, NeoNurture+, contributed to severe intestinal injuries in vulnerable newborns. Attorneys representing more than 3,800 families argued that internal testing data showed elevated risks but that the company failed to strengthen its warnings or reformulate the product. The jury awarded $312 million in damages in one bellwether case, opening the door to thousands of similar claims nationwide.</p>
      <p class="post-body">Among the plaintiffs are Daniel and Aisha Whitmore of Peoria, Illinois. Their son, Caleb Whitmore, was born at 29 weeks and fed NeoNurture+ while in the neonatal intensive care unit. At just three weeks old, Caleb developed a catastrophic intestinal condition that required emergency surgery. Portions of his intestine were removed. Now age five, he undergoes regular liver monitoring and immune function testing.</p>
      <p class="post-body">"They told us this was designed for fragile babies," Aisha Whitmore said outside the courthouse. "We trusted them completely. Instead, our son will face medical uncertainty for the rest of his life."</p>
      <p class="post-body">In the months that followed, thousands of additional claims were filed. Many parents reported that their children developed long-term complications, including compromised immune systems, liver dysfunction, and heightened cancer risks later in childhood. Pediatric specialists testified that early organ damage can create cascading health vulnerabilities that may not fully manifest for years.</p>
      <p class="post-body">But before most families could collect compensation, the corporation executed a complex corporate restructuring strategy commonly referred to as the Texas Two Step. The maneuver involves splitting the company into two separate entities under Texas law: one retains the profitable assets, while the other assumes the legal liabilities. The newly created entity then files for bankruptcy protection, halting pending lawsuits and forcing claimants into a prolonged bankruptcy process.</p>
      <p class="post-body">Legal experts say the strategy, while technically lawful, effectively shields the parent corporation's assets. "It allows a solvent company to isolate its liabilities and limit exposure," said one bankruptcy attorney familiar with the filings. "Families expecting timely compensation may now wait years."</p>
      <p class="post-body">"It's devastating," said Daniel Whitmore. "We fought for accountability, and now it feels like they've stepped sideways to avoid it." Meanwhile, SilverVale continues to report strong international sales of its other infant nutrition products.</p>
      <p class="post-body">For families like the Whitmores, the courtroom victory that once felt like justice now feels uncertain. "We're not looking for a windfall," Aisha said quietly. "We just want our son's medical future secured. And we want someone to admit what happened."</p>
      <p class="post-body">As bankruptcy proceedings unfold, thousands of parents remain in limbo, uncertain whether meaningful compensation or accountability will ever follow the verdict they once believed marked the end of their fight.</p>
